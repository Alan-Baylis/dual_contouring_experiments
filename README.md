# Dual Contouring Experiments

This repository is part of hallpaz's master thesis, entitled "Adaptive Implicit Surfaces Reconstruction From Depth Images".
Thesis was written under the direction of Professor Luiz Velho at IMPA and is [available here](http://www.visgraf.impa.br/Data/RefBib/PS_PDF/student-msc-2017-05-hallison-paz/thesis_hallison-1505.pdf)  (portuguese only).

The dual contouring algorithm implementation is based on [Tao Ju's original implementation](https://github.com/aewallin/dualcontouring), keeping most of the code, but changing a little the program architecture.

[OpenMesh](https://www.openmesh.org/) library is required due to the use of its half-edge datastructure.
